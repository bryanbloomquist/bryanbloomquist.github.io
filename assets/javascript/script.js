          I enlisted in the Army Reserves after high school so I could go to college because that is what you were supposed to do.  I changed majors three times because at 18 I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and before I could graduate I was activated and sent to Iraq.  I spent most of 2003 driving a fuel truck through Iraq and Kuwait.

          After I got home I got a job as a letter carrier at the USPS.  I had gone to college because I love to learn new things. As a mailman the only new things I learned came from the plethora of podcasts and audio books of which I listened in order to avoid boredom. When you arenâ€™t running away from dogs (it really is a thing) most of being a mailman is boredom.

          In 2018 I quit my job at the post office to become a full time dad and devote all my free time to learning web development, plus I completed a 24 week full stack web development boot camp at the University of Minnesota. I had learned some early coding when I was in college, even made a couple web sites that thankfully no longer exist (this was the era of hamster dance), but I never thought to make a career out of it.  Now, I'm ready to make it a career.
